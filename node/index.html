                    <p class="intro">Some of you reading this are experts on NodeJS, and that's fine... but you should leave. This post is not for you seasoned veterans, but rather those of you who read the title and thought "...what?" This will be a basic intro to NodeJS and what it's used for. 
                    <br><br>I'll start with a brief backstory of how NodeJS came about. The founder of NodeJS is Ryan Dahl. He noticed a file upload bar on Flickr that had to query the Web server to check on the progress of the upload. Dahl saw an area for improvement, and started working on NodeJS with Joyent.
                    <br><br>So what is NodeJS? First a textbook definition: "Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and IBM i". While the focus of NodeJS is on networking, it is a general purpose language that can be used for other things as well.
                    <br><br>You probably want to know what's so special about NodeJS. One of Node's key strengths is that it is good at idling. You might think of Node like the crime in <a href ="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111132042/3329749-gotham-city-urban-landscape-wallpaper.jpg">Gotham</a>, it never sleeps. 
                    <img src="adamweest.png" alt="adamwest" style="width:240px;height:310px; padding-right: 10px; float:left;">Node only exits when there is nothing left to do. Because it goes idle, but never goes to sleep, Node can handle multiple connections. Here's an example, let's say your website displays "Hello" then pauses 2 seconds before displaying "World". If 100 people accessed the site, it doesn't force users to go one after the other and take 200 seconds to run all the instances. Instead it runs these in parallel, and all 100 connections only take 2 seconds total. Pretty cool, right? Another thing that makes developing Node unique from other programming languages is that Node uses an asynchronous architecture. The server reacts to events and send events to the database. 
                    <br><br>So you might think you don't need a feature like that anyways, you're just making your website so you and your Vanilla WoW Guild can message each other about your raid plans this weekend. 
                    <img src="wowguy.png" alt="WoWGuy" style="width:270px;height:200px" align="right">While you might be an exception, in general people want to make their websites scalable, so when you start getting bigger you have a system in place that cooperates. NodeJS is scalable because it is non-blocking, it doesn't make the program wait. Instead it registers a callback and lets the program continue. This means it can handle concurrent operations without multiple threads of execution. 
                    <br><br>Does any of this sound interesting? If not, I'm terribly sorry. I'll let you get back to farming the Kurast Bazaar for runes. If it does, you can get more information on NodeJS with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I">this introduction from Ryan Dahl</a> and if you still want more you could also check out <a href="https://www.airpair.com/javascript/node-js-tutorial">this tutorial on NodeJS</a>. Good luck, and have fun!
